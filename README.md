# Office-Room
This is my Second-year Computer Science Mini-Project for Computer Graphics Lab.

The objective of this project is to show an office room containing an office chair, table, monitor which can display our names on screen, a bookshelf with a flower pot and a lamp which can be turned ON and OFF. At the start of the execution of the program, the PC screen is blank and the lamp is turned off, at which point we can right-click the mouse to open a drop-down menu that allows us to turn ON the lamp and display the text on the screen.
